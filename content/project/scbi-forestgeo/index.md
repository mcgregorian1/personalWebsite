This project represents work stemming from my time interning in-person with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute from 2018-2019 and continued work thereafter. On campus, I was part of the surveying team for the five-year census of the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) plot, which is a 26.5 ha tract representative of the Blue Ridge forest ecoregion. After the census, I contributed to other research in the plot including coordinating dendroband surveys, collecting data for a multi-plot study, and analyzed plant responses to drought over time (McGregor et al 2020).
