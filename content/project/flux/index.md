title: Analyzing how well we can determine phenology from satellite sensors by disentangling their relationship to ground-based flux towers.
summary: Eddy-covariance flux towers directly measure fluxes between the atmosphere and the planet, most notably carbon (CO2). The amount of carbon flux at any time is representative of phenology, or the timing of plants' life cycles. We are able to derive this phenology from satellites as well, but the exact correlation to the flux towers has been unknown (when using a lot of data). Our research aims to fix that.

By consistently emitting carbon into the atmosphere, humans are actively contributing to climate change and this has disastrous effects with regard to extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, etc. While we drastically need to reduce our emissions, we also need to have a robust way of monitoring global, annual carbon emissions. This can give us direct insights to how ecosystems are responding to climate change.

Though there are flux towers that directly capture carbon exchange between the ecosystems and the atmosphere, they are geographically limited and thus are not representative of the variety of ecosystems across the world. On the flip side, remote sensing analysis techniques have undergone rapid advancement, and prior studies have shown we might be able to capture carbon dynamics with satellite sensors. This can be done by scrutinizing phenometrics, or the timing of phenological events such as leaf-out and senescence. As these phenometrics can be derived from both the sensors and the flux towers themselves, we wanted to answer the question: how well can we use remote sensing to capture annual GPP?
