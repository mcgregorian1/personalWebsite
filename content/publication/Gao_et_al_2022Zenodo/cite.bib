	abstract = {This software is an R package providing the Bayesian land surface phenology (BLSP) model that quantifies long-term annual land surface phenology from temporally sparse optical remote sensing time series (originally developed for 30 m Landsat time series). For a more in-depth description, please read the paper: Long-term, medium spatial resolution annual land surface phenology with a Bayesian hierarchical model, The original repository of the software with instructions on installation and usage is on Github: https://github.com/ncsuSEAL/Bayesian\_LSP.},
