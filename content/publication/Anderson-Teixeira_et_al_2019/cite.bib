	abstract = {The climate sensitivity of forest ecosystem woody productivity ( ANPP 
woody ) will influence carbon cycle responses to future
changes in climate. Here, to understand how tree growth and forest
productivity respond to climate drivers including drought, we integrate
forest census data from a 25.6-ha ForestGEO plot in Virginia (USA),
tree-ring records for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPP
woody , leaf hydraulic trait measurements, and microhabitat
data. Across 109 years (1901-2009), radial growth of most species and
ecosystem-level ANPP woody responded negatively to warmer and
drier growing season conditions, but the same conditions in May-July of
the previous growing season were associated with increased growth. In
recent decades (1980-2009), responses were on average weaker and more
variable. Individual-level growth responses to three droughts (1964-66,
1977, 1999) were stronger among taller trees in dominant canopy
positions, those in wetter microsites, and for more drought-sensitive
species as assessed by leaf traits ( turgor loss at less negative leaf
water potential , greater shrinkage with leaf dehydration), with
substantial variation in the best predictor variables across given
droughts. Our results indicated that ANPP woody is primarily
limited by current growing season moisture, with a complex climate
sensitivity that likely reflects the use of stored carbohydrate
reserves. We conclude that although US eastern deciduous forests
currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their ANPP
woody may decline with reductions of growing season moisture
under projected hotter and potentially drier conditions. When droughts
occur, large dominant trees, drought sensitive species, and individuals
in moist microhabitats are likely to be most strongly affected. These
findings highlight the urgent necessity of integrating multiple data
streams across time scales to resolve the climate sensitivity of forest
productivity.},
