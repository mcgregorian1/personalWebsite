summary: IALE-NA Annual Meeting Contributed Poster
abstract: Originally a contributed talk before covid restrictions began, this poster covered phenology research I had done with my lab group at NC State. We compared phenology metrics (phenometrics) derived from the MODIS satellite sensor with phenometrics derived from eddy-covariance flux towers using FLUXNET data.
