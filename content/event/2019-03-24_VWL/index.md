summary: Contributed poster for the VWL annual meeting
abstract: For this poster I discussed current research from the Anderson-Teixeira lab at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, all conducted within the ForestGEO plot. This annual meeting was not like a typical conference, in that attendees were private and public landowners who had partnered with VWL for research purposes that previous year. Research in this poster was included in ~3 subsequent publications, including McGregor et al 2020.
