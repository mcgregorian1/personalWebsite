summary: CNR Graduate Research Symposium (Poster)
abstract: This was the first time we presented the lab's work on comparing MODIS-derived phenology with eddy-covariance flux tower phenology. Our hypothesis was that by using as much data as we could from the FLUXNET project, we might be able to see a stronger relationship between the two compared to previous studies.
