abstract: Detecting deforestation quickly and accurately has long been a focus of remote sensing, and with the large availability of satellite data, methods have continuously advanced. To lower temporal latency and increase accuracy, a growing number of studies have pursued multi-source approaches. For instance, in areas of persistent cloud cover, using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) may be the only source of observations. Typically, near real-time (NRT) monitoring approaches have used retrospective change detection methods to maximize an accuracy metric like the F1 score. Much less attention has been paid to potential parameter tradeoffs:
